                   MANILA – National Security Adviser (NSA) Eduardo Año on Tuesday said the government is committed to safeguarding Philippine national security, as highlighted by the arrest of a foreigner in Zambales for espionage-linked activities.
                </p>

                <P>Likewise, Año commended the Bureau of Immigration (BI), Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), Philippine National Police (PNP), and the National Intelligence Coordinating Agency (NICA) for their swift and decisive operation that led to the apprehension of 30-year-old Mongolian national Bold-Erdene Boldbaatar on Feb. 12.</P>

                <p>
                    "The said foreign national who enrolled as an aviation student concealed his military background and service with the People's Liberation Army, especially his jet fighter license from the PLA (People's Liberation Army) Air Force Aviation University. Such non-disclosure constitutes a serious violation of Philippine immigration laws. Moreover, his presence and actions in Zambales near vital military locations are clearly inconsistent with his purpose of stay in the country," Año said in a statement.
                </p>

                <p>
                    During solo flight exercises, Boldbaatar took aerial photographs of Iba Airport and the Palauig River area.
                </p>

                <p>
                    While the Philippines maintains an open and welcoming policy towards foreign students and aviation trainees, Año said transparency, compliance with visa conditions, and adherence to Philippine laws are non-negotiable.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Any act of misrepresentation, concealment, and activity that compromises national security will be dealt with firmly. Any attempt to exploit our openness, deceive our authorities, or operate against our national interest will be detected, disrupted, and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law," he added.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The country's top security adviser also called on the public to remain vigilant and to partner with government agencies in protecting the country and critical infrastructure.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    "Suspicious activities, including unexplained aerial activity of military and sensitive areas, misrepresentation of identity or background, or unusual behavior inconsistent with declared purposes should be reported immediately to the nearest local authorities, police station, NICA office, or AFP unit," he added.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Año also assured the public that the government will continue to strengthen coordination among intelligence, immigration, aviation, and law enforcement agencies to detect, deter, and respond decisively to any threat to Philippine national security. (PNA)
